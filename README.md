# Tic Tac Toe

Description

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Technologies Used for Production

-HTML5
-CSS5
-JavaScript
-jQuery
-AJAX
-Bootstrap

## Development Process

At the start of the project, I reviewed the requirements documentation (in full detail) and developed a game plan.

Game Plan

1. Planning
  -Wireframes
  -User Stories

2. Development(Stage 1)
  -Basic User Interface Design (HTML and CSS)
  -User Authentication (API, ajax)
  -Post, Get, Patch, Delete (API, ajax)

3. Development(Stage 2)
  -Game Logic

4. Development(Stage 3)
  -Game Event communication
  -Post, Get, Patch, Delete (API, ajax)

5. Development(Stage 4)
  -Implement Final User Interface Design (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)

6. Deploy
  -Deploy a functional single page application that meets requirements.

My problem-solving strategy was to solve one problem and move on to the next one. I tried to foresee problems during my planning process and planned my game plan accordingly. There were points during the development process that I was forced to revisit and alter prior solutions in order to solve new challenges. I used all available resources, including the internet (StackOverflow, Google, MDN, etc), other developers and instructors.

## Future Updates

-Update User Interface with CSS and Bootstrap
-Play Against Computer(AI function)
-Share games through social media

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to sign up, sign in, change the password and sign out from the application.
2. As a user, I want to play Tic Tac Toe (click on the game board and have the UI render 'X' or 'O') and have the application determine the winner (either 'X' or 'O') or if the game is a tie.
3. As a user, I want feedback from my actions displayed on the page after each interaction.
4. As a user, I want to start a new game (mid-game or after winner or tie is determined).
5. As a user, I want to see a history of the games associated with my user id.
6. As a user, I want to share my with my friends through social media.
